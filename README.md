# Backend code (index.mjs)
The code is written in JavaScript and uses the Express.js framework to create a web server.
It also uses several JavaScript libraries, such as "body-parser" for handling HTTP request data, and "ejs" for rendering HTML templates. 
This code is designed for server-side web development using Node.js, which is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server.
